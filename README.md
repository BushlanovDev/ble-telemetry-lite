# BLE Telemetry Lite

[English](./README.md) | [Russian](./README_RU.md)

Firmware for **ESP32-C3**, **ESP32-S3**, and similar microcontrollers, enabling telemetry broadcast from Crossfire and ELRS radio systems over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.

## Features

* Transmits Crossfire/ELRS telemetry from RC transmitters to phones, tablets, or laptops via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi
* Compatible with transmitters using Aux-serial output as well as direct connection to internal modules (e.g. Jumper RC up to T15)
* Telemetry display supported via [TelemetryViewer](https://github.com/RomanLut/android-taranis-smartport-telemetry/releases), [WebTelemetry](http://telemetry.skydevices.ru), or the built-in web interface

## Hardware

Development boards **ESP32-C3-SuperMini** (recommended) or **ESP32-S3-SuperMini**.
Other ESP32-based boards with BLE and Wi-Fi support may also work, but compatibility is untested and not guaranteed.

These boards are compact, affordable, and free from unnecessary components.
If using a different **ESP32-C3** or **ESP32-S3** board, note that pin numbering may differ from the microcontroller's internal pin numbers.
Refer to your board’s datasheet to identify correct pin mappings.

## Wiring

The module connects to the transmitter’s SerialAUX interface using 4 wires:

* 5V
* GND
* TX → to pin 3 (module RX)
* RX → to pin 4 (module TX)

Wiring to a RadioMaster Pocket transmitter example

If the transmitter lacks SerialAUX, connect the ELRS/Crossfire internal module’s TX pin directly to the module’s RX (pin 3).

Connection to internal TX on a Jumper T20 transmitter example

## Flashing and Configuration

Flash the firmware using the [Web Configurator](https://configurator.skydevices.ru) (for legacy versions).
BLE mode configuration is also done through the same interface.

Switch between BLE and Wi-Fi modes by pressing the **Boot** button on the module.

In Wi-Fi mode, connect to the **BLE Telemetry Lite** access point using the password: **12345678**.
The web interface is accessible at [http://192.168.4.1](http://192.168.4.1).
